VisionChef is a web app that helps users create recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridges. 
The app can identify the available items and suggest meal ideas by uploading an image of their fridge. 
Built with Django for the backend and React for the front end, VisionChef provides a seamless and interactive user experience. 
Whether you're searching for a quick snack or a full meal, VisionChef makes it easy to cook with what you have on hand.
